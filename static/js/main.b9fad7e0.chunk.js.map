I graduated high school from the School Of Environmental Studies in 2017. I then went\n                        to Inver Hills Community College for a year to get a start on my generals. I was not sure what career I wanted to pursue so I\n                        took a year off and worked as a kitchen supervisor in a small restaurant. I have always been interested in computers and technology, so beginning a \n                        career in the IT industry was a logical choice. When I heard about Prime Digital Academy's software engineering program I jumped on it.\n                        For those of you that do not know what Prime is, they teach and produce Full Stack Software Engineers and UX designers. </p>\n                </section>\n                <section className=\"career\">\n                    <h1 className=\"careerTitle\" >Summary Of My Growing Career</h1>\n                    <h1 className=\"years\">2018</h1>\n                    <h2 className=\"jobTitles\">Kitchen Supervisor</h2>\n                    <p className=\"jobDesc\"> I was the supervisor of a small kitchen in a movie theater restaurant that served really great food.
