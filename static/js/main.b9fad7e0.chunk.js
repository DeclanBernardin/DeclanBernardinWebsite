I graduated high school from the School Of Environmental Studies in 2017. I then went to Inver Hills Community College for a year to get a start on my generals.

I have always been interested in computers and technology, so beginning a career in the IT industry was a logical choice. When I heard about Prime Digital Academy's software engineering program I jumped on it.
